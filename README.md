Report Abstract : This report focuses on building a non-personalised and personalized collaborative filtering recommender system in the domain of business, more specifically, in recommending restaurants. The non personalized recommender system uses aggregated opinion, dampening mean algorithm (AO) while the personalized uses Singular Value Decmpositon(SVD) algorithm and Matric Factorisation Neural Networks(MFNN). All these algorithms are then evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error(MAE), coverage, serendipity and runtime. Conclusions are then drawn about these models. The aim of this project is to develop an understanding of the different types of recommender systems, their purpose anddomains of application and an understanding of recommender system users: usage behaviour, demographics,preferences, contextual information. This project also aims build on an indepth knowledge of recommender system algorithms and an understanding of recommender system evaluation methods.

# Skills Acquired:
- Perform data preprocessing steps, including filtering, downsampling, and feature selection on Yelp Dataset.
- Understand the concept of perosnalised and non-personalized recommendations.
- Implement algorithms such as K-Mean clustering algorithm, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Matrix Factorization Neural Networks (MFNN) .
- Understand and use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), coverage, serendipity, and runtime to evaluate recommender systems.
- Compare and analyze the performance of different algorithms based on evaluation metrics.
- Use visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, graphs) to represent data distributions and outcomes.
- Optimize hyperparameters such as the number of clusters (k), learning rates, and regularization terms.
- Technical writing by communicate findings and methodologies clearly in a report format.
